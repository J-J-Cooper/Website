				About me
			</h2>
			<p class="main-content__text">
			I am a quiet and hard working person with a passion for computing, particularly web development.
			<br>
			Though I do not have much experience in this field, during my years in education i consistently achieved the highest achievable grades in all web-related modules, and thoroughly enjoyed the time spent on them.
			
			<br>
			In university,my final year major project and dissertation was an experience in web development. I created a web-based information management system for a local food bank which they continue to use to this day.
			<br>
			<br>
			I enjoy the process of creating new things and bringing more into the world, such as creating websites digitally, as well as cooking and leatherworking in my free time. 
			<br>
			I also like learning and trying new things, particularly difficult tasks, as they often present challenges which allows me to improve my skills and grow as a person. 
			<br>
			For example, as you can see form the other pages of this website I am currently learning Hindi, which is considered one of the most difficult languages for native English speakers to learn.
